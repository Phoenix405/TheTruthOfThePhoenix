Being in this reality is really discomforting when you know the people inside of it.

There are criminals, hackers, drug dealers, murderers.
 
Society as you know it is scary alone and humanity views it as "normal" what is "normal" anymore??

There is no such thing as "normal" is there? "normal" is just something we call society to cope with the true side of it.

Society is much more messed up and continues to get darker and darker each day as we know it.
