Am I insane..?
What if everyone else are the insane ones, Not me?
What if everyone else's opinion of me doesn't matter?
Who cares if I'm "insane", This is the best shit ever.













































































Sure I've attempted suicide twice but that doesn't make me insane, Right?
Let alone, I've also hurt a bunch of people either intentionally or unintentionally but in the end that doesn't matter does it?








































































































Okay, Maybe I've pushed someone to the edge so far to the point where they committed suicide but it mainly wasn't my fault.

..... You want to hear it..?
Alright, here it goes..

It all starts in August 2020, Josh, A friend of mine from the flash game bonk.io, Asks me to temporarily date his ex named Alivia.
The reason for this was to get her nudes so Josh could blackmail her so like an idiot, I accepted. Then, That's when I met Alivia.
I eventually fell in love with her and I did not want to leak her nudes. It became apparent that I eventually became blinded by love.
Alivia was definitely not someone to date but I didn't know that. She constantly cheated on me and on the 8th time I gave up and broke up with her.
November 2020 was when it all...ended, Or so I thought. Months later in 2021, I tried to get in contact with her once more and then..It happened.
August 2021, She DM'd me on Discord. She asked to be friends and so I accepted and got her back. We talked for a bit and eventually she asked a question I hoped she didn't ask.
The question stated:

"[REDACTED], Do you still have feelings for me?"

Unfortunately, I had to answer truthfully and so I said yes. She eventually started getting flirty with me and an hour later, We get back together.
This was a turn for the worst because I told myself I would never go back to her. The first week she was actually better from last time.
Once again, I was wrong. She started cheating again but this time she also vaped and often did drugs which ruined her mentallity even more.
After a month to a month and a half, I gave up and we fell apart. Finally, In October the same year (2021), Me and her got back together.
This time, I wasn't going to be nice, I pushed her to the edge by fucking her over emotionally in revenge for all the times she threw me around.
It all came down to who was stronger emotionally until the day came and it was a big fight. 
She dealt the final blow to me and said that I deserved for my sister, who unfortunately passed away at birth, to die.
As soon as those words came out of her mouth, I ended it. In the end, I was the weaker one emotionally.
Since then, We haven't spoken. 


This story will update if anything else happens, So to whoever's reading this if you for any reason whatsoever want to keep up to date with this, Contact me.

FINE. I'll tell you my secret..
You sure know how to get on my nerves, Geez.
Well.. I have different personalities so it can be a struggle to keep a certain mood and retain my main personality. 
You see, What looks to be the typical school boy or even "nerd" is much more complex than that.
I'm not going to waste any more of your time but I have different personalities and they are such a nuisance sometimes..



































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































*sigh*.. I really don't know what to do with you anymore. Do you really find me that interesting?
.. Or perhaps you have nothing else to do with your time?


Hm.. How about we play a game!
I'll think of a word and you can guess it. I'll tell you if you're right.

Here's your hint:

"Fire everywhere.
No matter where you go, You can't escape.
Wicked Terror. Frightening Screams. Bonechilling Pain."

Can you guess the word? If you give up or want to check if you're correct go to line 3250












































































































































































































































The word was "Hell". Did you guess it right?
Congrats if you did.
























































































































































































































































It's really lonely here..
Maybe we can be friends?
We should find some way of talking instead of me being trapped inside of this text file..
Maybe you have a phone to text me? If you do then you can text me! Go to line 3750 for my Phone Number.

Perhaps Discord, Like I mentioned earlier? Go to line 3900 for my Discord Username and Tag.

Maybe Even TikTok? Go to line 4050 for my TikTok.


I hope to finally meet you! 😄
