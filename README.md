I'm not a Psychopath.. Am I?


No, No.

Psychopath isn't the word.
I'm more powerful than the rest. The others wouldn't understand. 


Alivia Boyd, I will defeat you and make sure you never come back to this world.

I will kill you if I have to.

I know everything I need to know to simply ruin your reputation and possibly even your life.
